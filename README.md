# RO Mobile: Eternal Love Rune Simulator
Project to convert rune names and descriptions on original calculator to SEA version in English.
SEA version is currently only EP 3.0 so some runes will be different from original calculator.
Also includes some UI cleanup and any other features/changes I feel like adding.


Original version by RoMELDE found here: https://github.com/RoMELDE/RuneBFS

All rune data rights belong to XinDong.
 
### Todo / Potential future features

- Make ALL text use Language Select in UI instead of being hardcoded to a specific language.
- Add translations for other languages as requested and provided by other users.
- Add ability to select EP version?
- Ability to save and import builds? (sort of already exists through url)
